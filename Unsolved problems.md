# Solved Problems

## The average age of $24$ students and the principal is $15$ years. When the principal's age is excluded, the average age decreases by $1$ year. What is the age of the principal?

1. 38
2. 40
3. 39
4. 37

**Solution**

🔴 **With the formula**

Let the age of the principal be $p$ and the sum of the ages of $24$ students be $S$. Then as per the question&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
15 &= \frac{S + p}{25} \cr
S + p &= 375
\tag{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

And&mdash;

$$ 14 = \frac{S}{24} \Longrightarrow S = 14\times 24 = 336 \tag{2}$$

From equation $1$ and $2$, $p = 375-336 = 39$. **Ans** ✅

This is not the most efficient approach, however. We can do better, much better.

🌳 **A better approach**

We can view this problem like this&mdash;

The average age of the $24$ students was $14$ years. When the principal is also included, the average becomes $15$.

If the principal had just $14$ years of age, than the average would have [remained $14$ itself](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/averages-and-mixture/averages-introduction/#addition-of-a-new-item-to-a-group).

But as he has increased the average of $24+1 = 25$ persons by $1$, so his age must be $14 + 25\times 1 = 39$. **Ans** ✅

## The average age of a family of $6$ members is $22$ years. If the age of the youngest member be $7$ years, what was the average age of family just before the birth of the youngest member?

1. 15
2. 18
3. 21
4. 12

**Solution**

At the time of the birth of the youngest member, everybody was $7$ years younger, so their average age was $22-7 = 15$ years. The youngest member has just born, so his age can be taken as $0$ at that point.

Therefore the sum of ages of five family members = $15\times 6 = 90$.

And their average is&mdash;
$$ \text{average} = \frac{90}{5} = 18 \quad✅$$

## The average age of $8$ persons in a committee is increased by $2$ years when two men aged $35$ years and $45$ years are substituted by two women. Find the average age of two women.

1. 48
2. 45
3. 51
4. 42
5. 46

**Solution**

Observe that the number of persons remains the same at $8$, therefore to increase the average of $8$ persons by $2$ years, we need $8\times 2 = 16$ years _extra_.

Thus the combined age of new women must be $16$ years more than the combined age of two outgoing men.

Therefore combined age of two incoming women $= (35 + 45) + 16 = 96$.

The average age of these women $= 96/2 = 48$ years. **Ans** ✅

## The average of $3$ numbers is $17$ and that of the first two is $16$. Find the third number.

1. 15
2. 16
3. 17
4. 19
5. 18

**Solution**

🔴 **Normal method** would be&mdash;
$$ \text{third number} = \text{Sum of three numbers} - \text{Sum of two numbers} $$

Thus $n = 17\times 3 - 16\times 2 \Longrightarrow 51 - 32 = 19$. **Ans** ✅

🌳 **Surplus and Deficiency method**

As $17$ is the average, the surplus above and the deficit below it will be equal.

The deficit below $17$ is $1\times 2 = 2$.

Therefore third number must be&mdash; $17+2 = 19$ **Ans** ✅

## Find the average of all prime numbers between $30$ and $50$.

1. 39.8
2. 38.8
3. 37.8
4. 41.8
5. 40.8

**Solution**
The prime numbers between $30$ and $50$ are&mdash; $31, 37, 41, 43, 47$.

Their average would be &mdash; $(31+37+41+43+47)/5 = 39.8$ **Ans** ✅

## The average of $5$ consecutive numbers is $n$. If the next two numbers are also included, the average will&mdash;

1. increase by $1$
2. remain the same
3. increase by 1.4
4. increase by 2
5. None of these

**Solution**

🔴 **Traditional Method**

Let the consecutive numbers are &mdash; $a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4$. As per the question&mdash;
$$ \frac{a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4)}{5} = n \newline \therefore\quad n = a+2 $$

If we include the next two numbers also, then the sum of all seven numbers will become &mdash; $a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4) + (a+5) + (a+6) = 7a + 21$.

Thus the average of these numbers will be&mdash; $(7a+21)/7 = a+3 \Longrightarrow (a+2) + 1 = n + 1$.

Thus the average of these numbers will increase by $1$. **Ans** ✅

🌳 **A better method**

As the consecutive numbers are always in AP, we can use the method of [average as the middle term](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/progressions/average-of-an-ap/).

The middle-term of an AP always represents its average since an AP is balanced about its middle-term. You can also observe that the surplus above and the deficit below the middle term are equal in an AP.

Thus for five consecutive numbers, the third term ([being the middle-term](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/progressions/average-of-an-ap/#calculating-the-middle-term)) will be the average. Similarly, for seven consecutive numbers, the fourth term (again being the middle-term of seven terms) will be the average.

Thus the average shifts from the third term to the fourth term. As the numbers are consecutive, the fourth term will be $1$ more than the third.

Thus the average will increase by $1$. **Ans** ✅

💡 If you know this concept, this reasoning doesn't take even five seconds to yield the answer.

## The average of $50$ numbers is $38$. If two numbers, namely, $45$ and $55$ are discarded, the average of the remaining numbers is&mdash;

1. 36.5
2. 37
3. 37.6
4. 38
5. 37.5

**Solution**

🌳 **Using the formula**

It is straight-forward using the formula&mdash;
$$ \text{average of remaining numbers }= \frac{38\times 50 - (45 + 55)}{48} = 37.5 $$

🌳 **With proper reasoning**

If the averages of the discarded numbers were $38$ itself, then there would have been no change in the average of the remaining numbers. So those two numbers could have totalled $38\times 2 = 76$ to _not affect_ the average of the remaining $48$ numbers.

But they added up to $45 + 55 = 100$, i.e. $100-76 = 24$ more than they were supposed to.

That means that this $24$ has been taken out of the pockets of remaining $48$ numbers. Therefore the average of the remaining $48$ numbers will reduce by $24/48 = .5$.

Thus the average of the remaining numbers will be $\Longrightarrow 38 - 0.5 = 37.5$ **Ans** ✅

## In a family of $8$ males and a few ladies, the average monthly consumption of grain per head is $10.8$ kg. If the average monthly consumption per head is $15$ kg in the case of males and $6$ kg in the case of females, find the number of females in the family.

1. 8
2. 7
3. 9
4. 15
5. 16

**Solution**

This question can be done using the concept of weighted average or using the allegation equation. We are using the [concept of allegations](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/weighted-average-allegations-and-mixture/#generalization-of-this-approach).

Visualize this situation like this &mdash;

$$
\text{\small Women}\underset{\small n_2}{\overset{\normalsize 6}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 4.8}~
        \text{10.8}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 4.2}
\underset{\small 8}{\overset{\normalsize 15}{\LARGE|}} \text{\small Men}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
n_2\times 4.8 &= 8\times 4.2 \cr
\therefore\quad n_2 &= 7
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence the number of ladies is $8$. **Ans** ✅

## The average weight of $5$ men is decreased by $3$ kg when one of them weighing $150$ kg is replaced by another person. Find the weight of the new person.

1. 165 kg
2. 135 kg
3. 138 kg
4. 162 kg
5. 165 kg

**Solution**

As the number of men remained the same, that means they lost $5\times 3 = 15$ kg by replacement.

Therefore the new person must be $150 - 15 = 135$ kg **Ans** ✅

## The average score of a cricketer in three matches is $22$ runs and in two other matches, it is $17$ runs, Find the average in all $5$ matches.

1. 20
2. 19.6
3. 21
4. 19.5
5. 20.5

**Solution**

🌳 **Using formula** &mdash; ${(22\times 3 + 17\times 2)}/{5} = 20$ **Ans** ✅

🔴 **Using allegation equation** &mdash;

$$
\underset{\small 2}{\overset{\normalsize 17}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small x}~
        \text{A}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small y}
\underset{\small 3}{\overset{\normalsize 22}{\LARGE|}}
$$

The ratio of distances will be the inverse of the number of matches&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{y} &= \frac{3}{2}\cr
\text{and } x+y &= 5 \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving these equations, we get $x = 3, \quad y = 2$.

Average $A = 17 + 3 = 20$. **Ans** ✅

## The average of $13$ papers is $40$. The average of the first $7$ papers is $42$ and of the last seven papers is $35$. Find the marks obtained in the $7th$ paper.

1. 23
2. 38
3. 19
4. 39
5. None of these

**Solution**

As there are $13$ papers, the $7th$ paper is being counted in both the averages. Visually&mdash;

$$
\overbrace{
    \underbrace{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_7}_ {\text{Sum = } 7\times 42 = 294}, a_8, \ldots a_ {13}}^{\text{Sum =} 13\times 40 = 520}
$$

As per the question, the sum of all $13$ papers is $13\times 40 = 520$ and the sum of first $7$ papers is $7\times 42 = 294$.

Thus the sum of last $6$ papers from $a_8 ~to~a_ {13}$ must be $520 - 294 = 226$. ️&mdash; 1️⃣

As has been given that the average of last $7$ terms from $a_7 ~to~ a_ {13}$ is $35$, therefore their sum must be $7\times 35 = 245$. &mdash; 2️⃣

Thus $a_7$ can be calculated as $\Longrightarrow$ Sum of last $7$ papers $-$ Sum of last $6$ papers, i.e. $245 - 226 = 19$ **Ans** ✅

## The average height of $30$ girls out of a class of $40$ is $160$ cm and that of the remaining girls is $156$ cm. The average height of the whole class is&mdash;

1. 158 cm
2. 158.5 cm
3. 159 cm
4. 157 cm
5. 160 cm

**Solution**

🌳 **With formula**
$$ average = \frac{30\times 160 + 10\times 156}{40} = 159 ~cm ~✅$$

🌳 **[With allegations](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/weighted-average-allegations-and-mixture/#generalization-of-this-approach)**

$$
\underset{\small 10}{\overset{\normalsize 156}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small x}~
        \text{A}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small y}
\underset{\small 30}{\overset{\normalsize 160}{\LARGE|}}
$$

$$ x + y = 4 \tag{1} $$

$$ \frac{10}{30} = \frac{y}{x} \Longrightarrow x = 3y $$

From above two equations, we get $x = 3, y = 1$.

Thus $A = 156+x \Longrightarrow 159$ **Ans** ✅

## The average weight of a class of $40$ students is $40$ kg. If the weight of the teacher is included, the average weight increases by $500$ gm. The weight of the teacher is &mdash;

1. 40.5 kg
2. 60 kg
3. 62 kg
4. 60.5 kg
5. 64 kg

**Solution**
The teacher needs $40$ kgs of weight to maintain the group average and another $41\times 0.5 = 20.5$ kgs to raise the average weight of $41$ persons including himself.

So his weight must be $40 + 20.5 = 60.5$ **Ans** ✅

## In an exam, a student scores $2$ marks for every correct answer and loses $0.5$ marks for every wrong answer. A student attempts all the $100$ questions and scores $120$ marks. The number of questions he answered correctly was &mdash;

1. 50
2. 45
3. 60
4. 68
5. None of these

**Solution**

🌳 **Using Equations**
Let $x$ be the number of questions he got correct so $100-x$ must be the number of questions he has gotten incorrect. Now, as per the question&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x - (100-x)\times (\frac{1}{2} ) &= 120 \cr
\therefore\quad 4x - 100 + x &= 240 \cr
\therefore\quad x &= 68
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus he has gotten $68$ questions correct. **Ans** ✅

🌳 **Using thought process**

This is an interesting problem. Instead of thinking for the correct answers, we need to think of the incorrect answers.

See, the maximum marks which can be obtained are $100\times 2 = 200$.

Now, think of it like this&mdash; _if he gets one incorrect answer, he would lose $2.5$ marks&mdash; i.e. $0.5$ mark for actual negative marking and $2$ marks which he could have gotten if his answer was correct._

Thus for every incorrect answer, he loses $2.5$ marks, so to get $120$ marks, he would have to lose $200-120 = 80$ marks which means that he must have gotten $80/2.5 = 32$ questions incorrect.

Thus the number of questions he had gotten correct are $100 - 32 = 68$. **Ans** ✅

## Three years ago, the average age of a family of $5$ members was $17$ years. A baby having been born, the average of the family is the same today. What is the age of the baby?

1. 1 year
2. 2 years
3. 6 months
4. 9 months

**Solution**

If the baby hadn't taken birth, [the average age of the family today must have been $17 + 3 = 20$ years](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/averages-and-mixture/averages-introduction/#things-to-remember). It means that the sum of the ages of five members is $20\times 5 = 100$ &mdash; 1️⃣

Now, including the baby, the average age of the family members is $17$, so the sum of the ages of all $6$ family members is $17\times 6 = 102$ &mdash; 2️⃣

Therefore, the age of the baby must be&mdash; $102 - 100 = 2$ years **Ans** ✅

## The average salary per head of all the workers in a company is Rs. 95. The average salary of $15$ officers is Rs. 525 and the average salary per head of the rest is Rs. 85. Find the total number of workers in the workshop.

1. 660
2. 580
3. 650
4. 460

**Solution**

🔴 **Using standard formula**

Let the total number of workers, including the officers, is $n$. Thus using the formula&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
95 &= \frac{15\times 525 + (n-15)\times 85}{n} \cr
\therefore\quad 95\times n &= 7875 + 85\times n - 1275 \cr
\therefore\quad 10\times n &= 6600 \cr
\therefore\quad n &= 660
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence the number of total workers is $660$. **Ans** ✅

🌳 **Using the allegation equation**

$$
\text{\small Labors}\underset{\small p}{\overset{\normalsize 85}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 10}~
        \text{95}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 430}
\underset{\small 15}{\overset{\normalsize 525}{\LARGE|}} \text{\small Officers}
$$

Let the number of workers having an average salary of $85$ is $p$. Thus using the [allegation equation](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/weighted-average-allegations-and-mixture/#generalization-of-this-approach)&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{p}{15} &= \frac{430}{10} \cr
\therefore\quad p &= 645
\end{aligned}
$$

The total number of workers, including the officers is $645 + 15 = 660$ **Ans** ✅

## Find the average increase rate of increase in the population in the first year is $30\%$ and that in the second year is $40\%$.

1. 41
2. 56
3. 40
4. 38
5. 39

**Solution**

Let the initial population is $100$. Thus after &mdash;

-   First increase of $30\%$, population becomes $\Longrightarrow (100\times 130)/100 = 130$.
-   Second increase of $40\%$, population becomes $\Longrightarrow (130\times 140)/100 = 182$. &#37;

<!-- Or in one line, this process can be written as &mdash;

$$ 100~~ \underset{\small +30}{\xrightarrow {\small +30\%}} \quad 130 \quad \underset{\small +52}{\xrightarrow{\small +40\%}} \quad 182  $$ -->

Thus net increase in the population is $(182-100)\times 100/100 = 82\%$.

The average percentage increase will be $82/2 = 41\%$. **Ans** ✅

> 🍎 If we have successive increments of $x\%$ and $y\%$, then the formula for computing the net increase in percents is $x+y + (xy)/100$. If we are given the decrements or discounts, then we put negative values in this formula i.e. $-x$ in place of $x$ and $-y$ in place of $y$.

⚠️ In this question, we are given increases of $30\%$ and $40\%$ but the average comes out at $41\%$, more than both of these. Why is it so, when [we have explicitly stated here that the average must lie between the lowest and highest values](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/averages-and-mixture/averages-introduction/#range-of-average)?

That's because the second percentage increase of $40\%$ is not on the initial population but is on the successive intermediate population. If the $40\%$ increase were given on the initial population, then the net increase would have been $30$ and $40$ respectively and the average increase in percents would have been $(30 + 40)/2 = 35$, just what we think it should be.

## A batsman makes a score of $270$ runs in the $87th$ innings and thus increases his average by a certain number of runs that is a whole number. Find the possible values of the new average.

1. 98
2. 184
3. 12
4. All of these.

**Solution**

Since in the $87th$ innings, he has to increase the average of $86$ previous innings in whole numbers. Therefore he can increase his average either by $1$ or by $2$ or by $3$. He cannot increase his average by $4$ or more since it would require $86\times 4 = 344$ or more runs in the $87th$ innings whereas he has scored only $270$ runs.

Now, let us assume that his previous average of $86th$ innings is $a$. And the new average is $A$. As discussed, this $A$ can take values $a+1,~a+2,~and~a+3$.

Now, applying the formula of averages for $87$ innings &mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \frac{86\times a + 270}{87} \cr
\therefore\quad 87A - 86a &= 270
\tag{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, in equation $1$, we check for three cases mentioned above &mdash;

-   If $A = a+1$, then $a = 183$, $A = 184$
-   If $A = a+2$, then $a = 96$, $A = 98$
-   If $A = a+3$, then $a = 9$, $A = 12$

Hence all three of these values are possible. **Ans** ✅

## The average of $71$ results is $48$. If the average of the first $59$ results is $46$ and that of the last $11$ is $52$, find the $60th$ result.

1. 132
2. 122
3. 134
4. 128
5. 136

**Solution**

The $60th$ result can be obtained by the below process&mdash;
$$ a_ {60} = \text{Sum of all results} - (\text{Sum of first 59 results} + \text{Sum of last 11 results}) $$

Putting all the values&mdash;
$$ a_ {60} = 71\times 48 - 59\times 46 - 11\times 52 \Longrightarrow 122 \quad ✅$$

## With an average speed of $40$ km/h, a train reaches its destination in time. If it goes with an average speed of $35$ km/h, it is late by $15$ minutes. The length of the total journey is&mdash;

1. 40 km
2. 70 km
3. 30 km
4. 80 km
5. 60 km

**Solution**

Let the initial time taken by the train is $t$ hours and the distance is $d$. As per the question&mdash;
$$ 40\times t = d \tag{1} $$

Now, again, as per the question&mdash;
$$ 35\times (t + 15/60) = d \tag{2} $$

(_In this equation, we have converted $15$ minutes into hours ($15/60$) as the speed has been given in km per hours_).

Solving these equations, we get $t = 7/4$ hours and $d = 70$ km. **Ans** ✅

## In an exam, the average was found to be $x$ marks. After deducing the computational error, the average marks of $94$ candidates got reduced from $84$ to $64$. The average thus came down by $18.8$ marks. The number of candidates who took the exam were&mdash;

1. 100
2. 90
3. 110
4. 105
5. 120

**Solution**

Let the total number of students be $n$.

Then as per the question&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
n\times 18.8 &= 94 \times (84-64) \cr
\therefore\quad n &= \frac{94\times 20}{18.8} = 100
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence the total number of students is $100$. **Ans** ✅

## The average age of a group of persons going for a picnic is $16.75$ years. $20$ new persons with an average age of $13.25$ years join the group on the spot due to which the average of the group becomes $15$ years. Find the number of persons initially going for the picnic.

1. 24
2. 20
3. 15
4. 18

**Solution**

Using the [allegation equation](https://mathbybihari.com/cat/weighted-average-allegations-and-mixture/#generalization-of-this-approach) &mdash;

$$
\text{\small New persons}\underset{\small 20}{\overset{\normalsize 13.25}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 1.75}~
        \text{15}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 1.75}
\underset{\small n}{\overset{\normalsize 16.75}{\LARGE|}} \text{\small Original group}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{20}{n} &= \frac{1.75}{1.75} \cr
\therefore\quad n &= 20
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $20$ persons were going for picnic initially. **Ans** ✅

## The average of $n$ numbers is $z$. If the number $x$ is replaced by $x'$, then the average becomes $z'$. Find the relation between $n, z, z', x$ and $x'$.

1. $n(z'-2) = (x'-x)$
2. $n(x'-x) = z'$
3. $n(z-z') = (x-x')$
4. $n(x-x') = (z-z')$

**Solution**

Let the sum of all numbers excluding $x$ is $S$. Then before the replacement&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
z &= \frac{S + x}{n} \cr
\end{aligned}
$$

After replacement&mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
z' &= \frac{S+x'}{n} \cr
\therefore\quad  z'&= \frac{S + x + (x' -x)}{n} \quad\therefore \text{added and subtracted }x\cr
\therefore\quad z'&= \frac{S+x}{n} + \frac{x' -x}{n} \cr
\therefore\quad z'&= z + \frac{x' -x}{n} \cr
\therefore\quad n(z' -z) &= (x' -x) \cr
\therefore\quad n(z-z') &= (x-x')
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence answer is $C$. **Ans** ✅

## The average salary of workers in a company is Rs. $2000$, the average salary of faculty being Rs. $4000$ and the management trainees being Rs. $1250$. The total number of workers could be&mdash;

1. 450
2. 300
3. 110
4. 500

**Solution**
Using the allegation equation&mdash;

$$
\text{\small Management trainees}\underset{\small n_1}{\overset{\normalsize 1250}{\LARGE|}}
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 750}~
        \text{2000}~
    \overbrace{\text{------------ }}^{\small 2000}
\underset{\small n_2}{\overset{\normalsize 4000}{\LARGE|}} \text{\small Faculties}
$$

$$ \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{2000}{750} = \frac{8}{3} $$

As the ratio of $n_1$ and $n_2$ is of the form $8:3$, so their total must be of the form $8k + 3k = 11k$. Thus the total number of workers must be divisible by $11$.

Out of the given options, $C$ fits correct. **Ans** ✅

## A certain number of trucks were required to transport $60$ tons of steel wire from city A to B. However, it was found that since each truck could take $0.5$ tons of cargo less than originally planned, another $4$ trucks were needed. How many trucks were initially planned to be used?

1. 10
2. 15
3. 20
4. 25

**Solution**

Let the number of trucks planned to be used is $n$ and the estimated capacity of each truck was $c$ tons.

Therefore, as per the question&mdash;
$$ n\times c = 60 \tag{1} $$

Again, as per the question&mdash;
$$ (n+4)\times (c+0.5) = 60 \tag{2}$$

Now, if you try to solve these two equations using the traditional method, it would take a very long time.

We can instead try option elimination method for the value of $n$.

Both the equations are satisfied at $n = 20$, and $c = 3$. **Ans** ✅

## A team of miners planned to mine $1800$ tons of ore during a certain number of days. Due to technical difficulties in one-third of the planned number of days, the team was able to achieve an output of $20$ tons of ore less than the planned output for each day. To make up for this, the team overachieved for the rest of the days by $20$ tons every day. The result was that the team completed the task one day ahead of time. How many tons of ore did the team initially plane to ore per day?

1. $50$ tons
2. $100$ tons
3. $150$ tons
4. $200$ tons
5. $250$ tons

**Solution**

Let the number of planned days be $n$ and the initially estimated capacity for each day was $c$ tons per day.

As per the question&mdash;
$$ n\times c = 1800 \tag{1}$$

In one-third days, the team mined &mdash;
$$ \frac{n}{3} \times (c-20) \text{ ~tons}$$

As the team has completed the task one day ahead of time therefore the team worked for remaining $(2n/3) - 1$ days. In this period, the team must have mined &mdash;
$$ \left[\frac{2n}{3} -1\right] \times (c+20) \text{~ tons}$$

These two outputs must add up to $1800$ tons. Therefore &mdash;

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{n}{3} \times (c-20) + \left[\frac{2n}{3} -1\right] \times (c+20) &= 1800 \cr
\therefore\quad20n - 3c &= 60
\end{aligned}
$$

And we already have equation $(1)$ $\Longrightarrow n\times c = 1800$

Solving these two equations using traditional methods is a time-consuming task. We can instead try options.

Option $B$ satisfies both the equations correctly i.e. $n = 100$, $c = 18$. **Ans** ✅
